                    Hi! <br> <br>

                    Emmet here, aka ‘Green Dot’. I started this YouTube channel in 2021 as a way of combining my passion
                    for aviation and my
                    fascination with Psychology. <br> <br>

                    My interest in aviation began with a toy plane I received as a present when I was 5 years old. I
                    would try to peer
                    through the painted-on cockpit windows, and imagine that behind them, there must be 8 people
                    frantically flicking
                    switches and manipulating levers trying to get the massive machine in the air. How else could a
                    machine so big and
                    unwieldy fly? <br><br>

                    Now in my 20s, my understanding of what goes on in the cockpit has changed, but flying retains that
                    same sense of magic
                    and wonder to me. There is something miraculous about the fact that it’s possible at all. And by
                    humans! <br><br>
                </p>
            </div>

        <div class="about-content">

            Hence my other great interest -- Psychology. How is it that such a plain-looking organ as the brain, can
            give rise to
            the sheer variety of behaviours we see in people, let alone to conscious awareness? <br><br>

            To satisfy this curiosity, I studied Psychology in university, getting both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s
            degree in the
            subject. <br><br>

            I enjoyed this immensely, but, as it turned out, I joined Psychology too early in its history to get the
            answers to all
            of my questions (but I did learn how to frame the questions better!). <br><br>

            After university, I worked as a researcher in the field of Educational Psychology. The work was interesting,
            but I still
            had an itch to do something in aviation. As a result, I created Green Dot Aviation in late 2021, making
            videos which
            focus on the psychological side of aviation accidents and incidents. <br><br>

            Since then, it’s become a full-time job, and I’m delighted that all sorts of people, from pilots to those
            who aren’t
            even interested in aviation enjoy the videos and find them educational. <br><br>

            I love what I do, and I am incredibly grateful for the opportunities that this channel and its supporters
            have given me.
            <br><br>
            I am now learning to fly, and am most of the way towards getting my Private Pilot’s License, with the aim of
            one day
            fulfilling my childhood dream of being an airline pilot. <br><br>

            I hope you enjoy these videos and learn something from them. I am lucky enough to have grown a (very
            talented) team to
            make them with me, and our aim is to keep improving them for you, so that we produce the highest-quality
            videos of their
            kind on the internet. <br><br>
