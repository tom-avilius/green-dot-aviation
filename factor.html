                    Engineers will tell you that the most failure-prone part of any machine is the part which is most
                    complex. In an
                    aircraft, the most complicated part is the minds of the people who operate it. <br><br>

                    In my videos, I use my knowledge of Psychology to shed light on the reasons behind aircraft
                    accidents, which almost
                    always involve this so-called ‘human factor’. <br><br>

                    Along with incredible improvements in avionics (aviation electronics) over the past few decades, the
                    biggest
                    improvements to aviation safety have been the result of a better understanding of the role that
                    Psychology plays in the
                    cockpit.

            <br>

            Innovations such as Crew Resource Management have revolutionised the way pilots are trained, and the way
            that they
            practise day-to-day. This has made flying much safer than it was even just 30 or 40 years ago. <br><br>

            The aim of this channel is to highlight these changes, and to show where the industry is going as a result.
